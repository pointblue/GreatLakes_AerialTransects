# WGLBBO Maps and Data from the Great Lakes Commission’s “Monitoring and Mapping Avian Resources in the Nearshore and Open Waters of Lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan, and St. Clair”   
<p>  
The Western Great Lakes Bird and Bat Observatory (hereafter WGLBBO, since renamed the Lake Michigan Bird Observatory) surveyed the western offshore waters of Lake Michigan for waterfowl and waterbirds 
as part of Phase 2 of the Great Lakes Commission’s pelagic bird survey project entitled “Monitoring and Mapping Avian Resources in the Nearshore and Open Waters of Lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan, and 
St. Clair”. We flew our aerial surveys from northern Door County, Wisconsin, to the Wisconsin/Illinois border, utilizing a twin-engine aircraft and flying parallel transects in survey blocks oriented 
north and south, offshore from the western Lake Michigan shoreline, during fall and early winter of 2013, and late winter and spring of 2014. The data and maps found here cover numbers of individuals, 
migration timing, and distribution of birds found in the zone from 1.6 to 16.0 kilometers (one mile to ten miles) offshore of the western Lake Michigan shoreline region during Phase 2 of the 
aforementioned project. Only maps resulting from the WGLBBO western Lake Michigan surveys are included.
